Properties and types of series
Trend : A long-term increase or decrease in the data. This can be seen as a slope (is doesn’t have to be linear) roughly going through the data.
Seasonality : A time series is said to be seasonal when it is affected by seasonal factors (hour of day, week, month, year, etc.). Seasonality can be observed with nice cyclical patterns of fixed frequency.
Cyclicity : A cycle occurs when the data exhibits rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency. These fluctuations are usually due to economic conditions, and are often related to the “business cycle”. The duration of these fluctuations is usually at least 2 years.
Residuals : Each time series can be decomposed in two parts:
- A forecast, made up of one or several forecasted values
- Residuals. They are the difference between an observation and its predicted value at each time step. Remember that
Value of series at time t = Predicted value at time t + Residual at time t
